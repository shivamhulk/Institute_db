# Institute DB

Institute DB is a C++ project designed to handle database operations for an educational institute. It can be used to manage student records, faculty information, courses, and more.

## Features

- Add, update, delete, and search records
- Manage student and faculty data
- Simple command-line interface
- Data persistence (if file/database support is implemented)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Make (optional, if using a Makefile)

### Building

Compile the project using g++:

```sh
g++ -o institute_db main.cpp
```

Replace `main.cpp` with your main source file and add other `.cpp` files as needed.

Or, if you have a Makefile:

```sh
make
```

### Running

Run the compiled executable:

```sh
./institute_db
```

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the database. Typical operations may include:

- Adding a new student or faculty member
- Searching for records
- Displaying all entries
- Deleting or updating records

## File Structure

```
.
├── institute dbms.cpp
├── README.md
```

## Customization

You can extend the system to add more modules (e.g., courses, departments) or integrate with a more sophisticated database.
